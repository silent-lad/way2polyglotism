# Way2Polyglotism

This is my attempt to learn/brush up various things such as - 
- Design patterns
- TDD
- Microservice architecture
- and many more software first and second principles in as many language as possible/feasible.

Right now I am aiming at only 3 of them
- Java 
- Golang
- Python

I know I should include langaueges of different paradigms like clojure to expand my thingking and I definitely will add them once I get a hang of this project. 

If you landed on this repo and read it till here. I am open for both feedback on my leanring and any question you might have.
Have fun, Stay toxic
